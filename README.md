##### _a mixed bag of crypto functions_

&nbsp;

Hiiii, I'm Silvia! In this repository I am uploading small functions and codes that I'm making of cool crypto stuff :alien:

For errors or suggestions, you can write to silvduck256_at_gmail_dot_com

### encrypt/decrypt functions

- Caesar cipher
- Vigenere cipher
- ECB - electronic codebook (with images)
- Diffie–Hellman key exchange
- RSA (key generation, encryption, decryption & signing)
- ElGamal (key generation, encryption, decryption & signing)
- HMAC

&nbsp;

### math functions

- Module
- Euclidean algorithm (greatest common divisor)
- Bezout's identity
- Euler's totient function
- Euler's theorem
- Primality test, Fermat and Miller-Rabin

&nbsp;

### blockchain (Bitcoin)

- Block hashing
- Merkle Root
